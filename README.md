# BettaOS
A strong OS named after the common Betta Fish. **Still under development**

# Running The OS

First clone this repo, then run it in your IDE. If you run it, you should see a bunch of files appear. That is good. Then a GUI will appear, and that is what I Have now. Working on Commands.


# Currently Have:
- Basic Text macro Output
- Basic GUI

# Plan On Implementing:
- Commands
- A lot more
- File access
